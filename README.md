## Let's build it!

First thing you will need is the Golang environment setup. [The install process](https://golang.org/doc/install) pretty simple you can use [brew](http://brew.sh) to install go.  You will also need to set the $GOPATH environment variable and point it at your go workspace.

```sh
$ brew install go
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
```

Go provides a command for retrieving dependencies called `go get`.  Since ion-connect is currently private it may be helpful (and more generally helpful) to force git to use ssh by default with  `git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"`

```sh
$ go get github.com/ion-channel/ion-connect
```

finally you can build ion-connect with the following:

```sh
$ go build github.com/ion-channel/ion-connect
```

## Don't forget the tests

Running the tests requires the install of a couple of test environment dependencies. You can use go to install these as well.

```sh
$ go get github.com/onsi/gomega
$ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo
```

You can then run the tests with the following command:

```sh
$ go test -v github.com/ion-channel/ion-connect/...
```

## Install from source

Once you feel your tests are up to snuff you can use the go install command to install the ion-connect binary in the go bin directory.

```sh
$ go install github.com/ion-channel/ion-connect
```

If you've added the $GOHOME/bin to you path you should now be able to get ion-connect action going.

### To get stuff 'cross-compiled':

```sh
$ GOOS=windows go build -o ion-connect/windows/bin/ion-connect.exe ./
$ rice append --exec ion-connect/windows/bin/ion-connect.exe -i ./lib

$ GOOS=linux go build -o ion-connect/linux/bin/ion-connect ./
$ rice append --exec ion-connect/linux/bin/ion-connect -i ./lib

$ GOOS=darwin go build -o ion-connect/darwin/bin/ion-connect ./
$ rice append --exec ion-connect/darwin/bin/ion-connect -i ./lib
```

## Your wish

Ion Connect provides a setup command called *configure*.  This should probably be the first command you run.  You will be prompted for your Ion Channel Secret Key which will be provided by an Ion Channel staff member.

```sh
$ ion-connect configure
Ion Channel Api Key []:
```

NOTE:  Ion Connect can also do configuration through environment variables.  The following variables are supported:

- `IONCHANNEL_SECRET_KEY` - allows the user to set the secret key used for authentication with Ion Channel
- `IONCHANNEL_ENDPOINT_URL` - allows the user to set the location of the Ion Channel api

The default endpoint url is the Ion Channel public/production environment.

You can then run various commands to query the Ion Channel system.  The best next step is the the help command.  From there you can see a list of top level commands and global options.

```sh
NAME:
   ion-connect - Interact with Ion Channel

USAGE:
   ./ion-connect [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

VERSION:
   0.6.8

COMMANDS:
   scanner     		set of commands for effecting artifacts or source code

GLOBAL OPTIONS:
   --debug     		display debug logging
   --insecure  		allow for insecure https connections
   --help, -h  		show help
   --version, -v  print the version
```

Commands that are only supported in test by supplying the Ion Channel API endpoint url using an environment variable, similar to the following:

```
$ IONCHANNEL_ENDPOINT_URL=https://api.test.ionchannel.io/ ion-connect metadata get-languages "hello, how are you"
[
  {
    "code": "en",
    "name": "English",
    "reliable": true
  }
]
```

That's it! You are well on your way to world domination.
